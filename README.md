This capstone project aimed to analyze and predict individuals' vaccination behavior for H1N1 and seasonal flu, with the broader goal of developing a scalable methodology to improve public health strategies and combat vaccine hesitancy. A range of machine learning models were applied, including Random Forest, XGBoost, Multiclass Logistic Regression, and K-Modes clustering, to identify key behavioral and demographic patterns influencing vaccination uptake. Based on the findings and cost analysis, the recommendation targeted interventions such as one-on-one counseling, provider reminders, and educational campaigns to maximize public health impact and cost savings. All model code and exploratory data analysis are available in the Code and Dataset2 folder, and the final report and presentation summarizing the approach and results are included for reference.
